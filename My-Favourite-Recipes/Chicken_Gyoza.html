  <p>Chicken gyoza is a delicious appetizer from Japan. These crescent-shaped dumplings are traditionally filled with meat and vegetables and then dipped in a savory sauce</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
  <h3>Chicken Gyoza:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>300 g ground chicken</li>
      <li>100 g Napa cabbage</li>
      <li>1 package Gyoza wrappers</li>
      <li>10 g scallion (spring onions)</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic grated</li>
      <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Gyoza Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>10 ml soy sauce</li>
      <li>10 ml rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Finely slice the Chinese cabbage and place in abowl. Add salt and mix together. Leave this to sit for 5 minutes. The salt willdraw out the moisture from the cabbage. After 5 minutes has passed, using yourhands, squeeze out any remaining water from the cabbage. Prepare the otheringredients in separate bowls for easy management.</li>
      <li>Mix the ground chicken, Chinese cabbage, scallions, soy sauce, sake, mirin, and grated garlic in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Place a gyoza wrapper in your weaker hand. With one finger, add a little water to the edge of one side of the gyoza. This willhelp with binding it together. Place 1 tbsp of filling in the center. Do not put too much as it will be hard to wrap the gyoza!</li>
      <li>Fold the gyoza in half. Then with your strongerhand, use your thumb and index finger to make small pleats along the edge ofone side of the gyoza. Aim for around 4 to 5 for one gyoza. Push the two sidesof the gyoza together as you make each pleat to help seal it tightly. Shape thegyoza so they are slightly curved.</li>
      <li>Heat your pan to a medium heat. Add a neutral oil and then add your gyoza with the flat side down. Fry until light brown on the bottom. Add 50ml water (about 1/4 cup) in thepan and cover with a lid. Wait till the water has mostly evaporated. This may take around 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Take off the lid if there is any remaining water, keep cooking until it is 100% evaporated. Enjoy!</li>
